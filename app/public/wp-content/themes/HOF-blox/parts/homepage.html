			<h2>How was the game of tennis able to expand from the Country Clubs to the Public  Parks and Public Schools in St Louis and nationally?</h2>
			<h2>Dwight Davis, St. Louis's visionary Park Commissioner, played a pivotal role. He spearheaded the construction of tennis courts in St. Louis City parks, making tennis accessible to all citizens. In 1923, he also served as President of the United States Lawn Tennis Association and later held an impressive political career, serving as Secretary of War in President Calvin Coolidge's cabinet from 1925 to 1929.</h2>

			<h2>How did a cold, dimly lit military building with five tennis courts laid out on a slick wood floor on Market Street in the City of St Louis produce over 500 national and  international tennis titles which include 22 Grand Slam singles and doubles titles?</h2>
			<h2>At the 138 Infantry Armory in the 1950’s and 60’s some of the greatest tennis  players in the history of the sport shared a wood drill floor with the military.  Because the building housed the only 5 indoor courts in St Louis and all the  players had to come together to practice champions were born. Sometimes in  sports the best competitors come from difficult environments and that was  certainly true at the St Louis Armory.</h2>

			<h2>How in 1975 could a young man from East St Louis play a Sumner High School  graduate for the men’s singles title at Wimbledon and forever change the game of  tennis?</h2>
			<h2>Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe met in the finals of Wimbledon in 1975. Arthur  became the first black man to win Wimbledon that year. Both Arthur and Jimmy  trained and played at the Armory. The slick wood floors prepared both players for  the fast grass courts at the All-England Club. Arthur won three Grand Slam titles in  singles and two in doubles. Ashe was the first Black player selected to the United States  Davis Cup team, and the only Black man ever to win the singles titles at Wimbledon, the  US Open, and the Australian Open. Ashe was a great tennis champion but he was a champion for social justice off the court. Connors held the top Association of Tennis  Professionals ranking for a then-record 160 consecutive weeks from 1974 to 1977 and a  career total of 268 weeks.

			<h2>Early Years and Tennis Expansion</h2>
			<h2>1900s - 1920s</h2>
			<h2>In the early 1900s, particularly in 1904, Dwight Davis, the St. Louis Park Commissioner, embarked on a visionary mission to make tennis accessible to all citizens. He built numerous tennis courts in St. Louis City parks, pioneering the idea of public access to the game. This initiative soon spread across the nation, influencing the expansion of tennis from exclusive country clubs to public parks and schools.</h2>

			<h2>The Armory: A Birthplace of Champions</h2>
			<h2>1960s - 1970s</h2>
			<h2>During the 1950s and 60s, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s, the 138 Infantry Armory, despite its cold and dimly lit setting, housed a wooden drill floor that incubated some of the greatest tennis players in history. The lack of indoor courts in St. Louis compelled players to practice together, fostering a competitive environment. This unique setting nurtured champions and provided a strong foundation for their successful careers.</h2>
